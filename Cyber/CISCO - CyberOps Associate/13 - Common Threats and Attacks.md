Risk management is the process that balances the operational costs of providing protective measures with the gains achieved by protecting the asset. There are four common ways to manage risk, as shown in the table:

| **Risk Management Strategy** | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Risk acceptance**          | This is when the cost of risk management options outweighs the cost of the risk itself. The risk is accepted, and no action is taken.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Risk avoidance**           | This means avoiding any exposure to the risk by eliminating the activity or device that presents the risk. By eliminating an activity to avoid risk, any benefits that are possible from the activity are also lost.                                                                                                        |
| **Risk reduction**           | This reduces exposure to risk or reducing the impact of risk by taking action to decrease the risk. It is the most commonly used risk mitigation strategy. This strategy requires careful evaluation of the costs of loss, the mitigation strategy, and the benefits gained from the operation or activity that is at risk. |
| **Risk transfer**            | Some or all of the risk is transferred to a willing third party such as an insurance company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Other commonly used network security terms include:
- **Countermeasure** - The actions that are taken to protect assets by mitigating a threat or reducing risk.
- **Impact** - The potential damage to the organization that is caused by the threat.



Many network attacks can be prevented by sharing information about **indicators of compromise** (IOC). Indicators of compromise are the evidence that an attack has occurred.

**Indicators of attack** (IOA) focus more on the motivation behind an attack and the potential means by which threat actors have, or will, compromise vulnerabilities to gain access to assets. IOAs are concerned with the strategies that are used by attackers.


It is important to understand that threat actors use a variety of security tools to carry out these attacks.

|**Category of Attack**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|eavesdropping attack|An eavesdropping attack is when a threat actor captures and listens to network traffic. This attack is also referred to as sniffing or snooping.|
|data modification attack|Data modification attacks occur when a threat actor has captured enterprise traffic and has altered the data in the packets without the knowledge of the sender or receiver.|
|IP address spoofing attack|An IP address spoofing attack is when a threat actor constructs an IP packet that appears to originate from a valid address inside the corporate intranet.|
|password-based attacks|Password-based attacks occur when a threat actor obtains the credentials for a valid user account. Threat actors then use that account to obtain lists of other users and network information. They could also change server and network configurations, and modify, reroute, or delete data.|
|denial-of-service (DoS) attack|A DoS attack prevents normal use of a computer or network by valid users. After gaining access to a network, a DoS attack can crash applications or network services. A DoS attack can also flood a computer or the entire network with traffic until a shutdown occurs because of the overload. A DoS attack can also block traffic, which results in a loss of access to network resources by authorized users.|
|man-in-the-middle attack (MiTM)|A MiTM attack occurs when threat actors have positioned themselves between a source and destination. They can now actively monitor, capture, and control the communication transparently.|
|compromised key attack|A compromised-key attack occurs when a threat actor obtains a secret key. This is referred to as a compromised key. A compromised key can be used to gain access to a secured communication without the sender or receiver being aware of the attack.|
|sniffer attack|A sniffer is an application or device that can read, monitor, and capture network data exchanges and read network packets. If the packets are not encrypted, a sniffer provides a full view of the data inside the packet. Even encapsulated (tunneled) packets can be broken open and read unless they are encrypted and the threat actor does not have access to the key.|

Information about social engineering techniques is shown in the table.

| Social Engineering Attack | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pretexting                | A threat actor pretends to need personal or financial data to confirm the identity of the recipient.                                                                                                               |
| Phishing                  | A threat actor sends fraudulent email which is disguised as being from a legitimate, trusted source to trick the recipient into installing malware on their device, or to share personal or financial information. |
| Spear phishing            | A threat actor creates a targeted phishing attack tailored for a specific individual or organization.                                                                                                              |
| Spam                      | Also known as junk mail, this is unsolicited email which often contains harmful links, malware, or deceptive content.                                                                                              |
| Something for Something   | Sometimes called “Quid pro quo”, this is when a threat actor requests personal information from a party in exchange for something such as a gift.                                                                  |
| Baiting                   | A threat actor leaves a malware infected flash drive in a public location. A victim finds the drive and unsuspectingly inserts it into their laptop, unintentionally installing malware.                           |
| Impersonation             | In this type of attack, a threat actor pretends to be someone else to gain the trust of a victim.                                                                                                                  |
| Tailgating                | This is where a threat actor quickly follows an authorized person into a secure location to gain access to a secure area.                                                                                          |
| Shoulder surfing          | This is where a threat actor inconspicuously looks over someone’s shoulder to steal their passwords or other information.                                                                                          |
| Dumpster diving           | This is where a threat actor rummages through trash bins to discover confidential documents.                                                                                                                       |
