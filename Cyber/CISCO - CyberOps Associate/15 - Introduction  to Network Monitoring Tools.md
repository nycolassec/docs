NetFlow is a Cisco IOS technology that provides 24x7 statistics on packets that flow through a Cisco router or multilayer switch. IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) is a version of NetFlow that is an IETF standard protocol.

For example, Cisco Stealthwatch collects NetFlow statistics to perform advanced functions including:
- **Flow stitching** - It groups individual entries into flows.
- **Flow deduplication** - It filters duplicate incoming entries from multiple NetFlow clients.
- **NAT stitching** - It simplifies flows with NAT entries.

SIEM systems include the following essential functions:
- **Forensic analysis** - The ability to search logs and event records from sources throughout the organization. It provides more complete information for forensic analysis.
- **Correlation** - Examines logs and events from different systems or applications, speeding detection of and reaction to security threats.
- **Aggregation** - Aggregation reduces the volume of event data by consolidating duplicate event records.
- **Reporting** - Reporting presents the correlated and aggregated event data in real-time monitoring and long-term summaries.
