An organization may have several guiding policies, as listed in the table.

|**Policy**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Company policies**|- These policies establish the rules of conduct and the responsibilities of both employees and employers.<br>- Policies protect the rights of workers as well as the business interests of employers.<br>- Depending on the needs of the organization, various policies and procedures establish rules regarding employee conduct, attendance, dress code, privacy and other areas related to the terms and conditions of employment.|
|**Employee policies**|- These policies are created and maintained by human resources staff to identify employee salary, pay schedule, employee benefits, work schedule, vacations, and more.<br>- They are often provided to new employees to review and sign.|
|**Security policies**|- These policies identify a set of security objectives for a company, define the rules of behavior for users and administrators, and specify system requirements.<br>- These objectives, rules, and requirements collectively ensure the security of a network and the computer systems in an organization.<br>- Much like a continuity plan, a security policy is a constantly evolving document based on changes in the threat landscape, vulnerabilities, and business and employee requirements.|

A comprehensive security policy has a number of benefits, including the following:

- Demonstrates an organizationâ€™s commitment to security
- Sets the rules for expected behavior
- Ensures consistency in system operations, software and hardware acquisition and use, and maintenance
- Defines the legal consequences of violations
- Gives security staff the backing of management

The table lists policies that may be included in a security policy.
