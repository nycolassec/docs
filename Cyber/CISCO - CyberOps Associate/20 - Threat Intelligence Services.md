**FireEye** is security company that uses a three-pronged approach combining security intelligence, security expertise, and technology
FireEye offers SIEM and SOAR with the Helix Security Platform,
Helix is cloud-hosted security operations platform that combines diverse security tools and threat intelligence into a single platform.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) offers a free service called Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS).
AIS enables the real-time exchange of cyber threat indicators.

The CVE serves as a dictionary of common names (i.e., CVE Identifiers) for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

The MITRE Corporation defines unique CVE Identifiers for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities to make it easier to share data.

Three common threat intelligence sharing standards include the following:
- **Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX)** - This is a set of specifications for exchanging cyber threat information between organizations. The Cyber Observable Expression (CybOX) standard has been incorporated into STIX.
- **Trusted Automated Exchange of Indicator Information (TAXII)** - This is the specification for an application layer protocol that allows the communication of CTI over HTTPS. TAXII is designed to support STIX.
- **CybOX** - This is a set of standardized schema for specifying, capturing, characterizing, and communicating events and properties of network operations that supports many cybersecurity functions.


A threat intelligence platform centralizes the collection of threat data from numerous data sources and formats. There are three major types of threat intelligence data. The first is indicators of compromise (IOC). The second is tools, techniques, and procedures (TTP). The third is reputation information about internet destinations or domains.
