Telemetria ==é o processo de coletar e analisar dados de sistemas remotos, como computadores, servidores e aplicativos==. No contexto de malware, a telemetria é uma lista de eventos que ocorrem em um computador protegido. 

A telemetria pode ser usada para: 

- Identificar sinais de malware
- Atualizar assinaturas de malware
- Melhorar a eficácia e a resposta do software de segurança
- Monitorar e analisar a infraestrutura de TI
- Gerar insights a partir dos dados coletados
- Tomar decisões informadas e tomar ações apropriadas

| **Risk Analysis**            | - This is a discipline in which analysts evaluate the risk posed by vulnerabilities to a specific organization.<br>- A risk analysis includes assessment of the likelihood of attacks, identifies types of likely threat actors, and evaluates the impact of successful exploits on the organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) has been designated as the custodian of the CVSS to promote its adoption globally. The Version 3 standard was developed with contributions by Cisco and other industry partners.


## CVSS Metric Groups
###### Base Metric Groups
This represents the characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time and across contexts. It has two classes of metrics:
- **Exploitability** - These are features of the exploit such as the vector, complexity, and user interaction required by the exploit.
- **Impact metrics** - The impacts of the exploit are rooted in the CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
###### Temporal Metric Group
This measures the characteristics of a vulnerability that may change over time, but not across user environments. Over time, the severity of a vulnerability will change as it is detected and measures to counter it are developed. The severity of a new vulnerability may be high, but will decrease as patches, signatures, and other countermeasures are developed.
###### Environmental Metric Group
This measures the aspects of a vulnerability that are rooted in a specific organization’s environment. These metrics help to rate consequences within an organization and allow adjustment of metrics that are less relevant to what an organization does.


**Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)**
This is a dictionary of common names, in the form of CVE identifiers, for known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.




The table lists the four potential ways to respond to risks that have been identified, based on their weightings or scores.

|**Risk**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Risk avoidance**|- Stop performing the activities that create risk.<br>- It is possible that as a result of a risk assessment, it is determined that the risk involved in an activity outweighs the benefit of the activity to the organization.<br>- If this is found to be true, then it may be determined that the activity should be discontinued.|
|**Risk reduction**|- Decrease the risk by taking measures to reduce vulnerability.<br>- This involves implementing management approaches discussed earlier in this chapter.<br>- For example, if an organization uses server operating systems that are frequently targeted by threat actors, risk can be reduced through ensuring that the servers are patched as soon as vulnerabilities have been identified.|
|**Risk sharing**|- Shift some of the risk to other parties.<br>- For example, a risk-sharing technique might be to outsource some aspects of security operations to third parties.<br>- Hiring a security as a service (SECaaS) CSIRT to perform security monitoring is an example.<br>- Another example is to buy insurance that will help to mitigate some of the financial losses due to a security incident.|
|**Risk retention**|- Accept the risk and its consequences.<br>- This strategy is acceptable for risks that have low potential impact and relatively high cost of mitigation or reduction.<br>- Other risks that may be retained are those that are so dramatic that they cannot realistically be avoided, reduced, or shared.|

### Vulnerability Management Life Cycle
###### Discover
Inventory all assets across the network and identify host details, including operating systems and open services, to identify vulnerabilities. Develop a network baseline. Identify security vulnerabilities on a regular automated schedule.
###### Prioritize Assets
Categorize assets into groups or business units, and assign a business value to asset groups based on their criticality to business operations.
###### Assess
Determine a baseline risk profile to eliminate risks based on asset criticality, vulnerability, threats, and asset classification.
###### Report
Measure the level of business risk associated with your assets according to your security policies. Document a security plan, monitor suspicious activity, and describe known vulnerabilities.
###### Remediate
Prioritize according to business risk and address vulnerabilities in order of risk.
###### Verifiy
Verify that threats have been eliminated through follow-up audits.

# Patch Management Techniques

Agent-based
This requires a software agent to be running on each host to be patched. The agent reports whether vulnerable software is installed on the host. The agent communicates with the patch management server, determines if patches exist that require installation, and installs the patches. The agent runs with sufficient privileges to allow it to install the patches. Agent-based approaches are the preferred means of patching mobile devices.

Agentless Scanning
Patch management servers scan the network for devices that require patching. The server determines which patches are required and installs those patches on the clients. Only devices that are on scanned network segments can be patched in this way. This can be a problem for mobile devices.

Passive Network Monitoring
Devices requiring patching are identified through the monitoring of traffic on the network. This approach is only effective for software that includes version information in its network traffic.
