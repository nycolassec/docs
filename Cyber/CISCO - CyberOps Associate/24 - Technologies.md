### Peer-to-Peer Networking and Tor
In peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, shown in the figure, hosts can operate in both client and server roles. Three types of P2P applications exist: file sharing, processor sharing, and instant messaging. In file sharing P2P, files on a participating machine are shared with members of the P2P network.

Processor sharing P2P networks donate processor cycles to distributed computational tasks. Cancer research, searching for extraterrestrials, and scientific research use donated processor cycles to distribute computational tasks.

Instant messaging (IM) is also considered to be a P2P application. IM has legitimate value within organizations that have geographically distributed project teams.

### ACLs
 The outside host’s return ICMP traffic is allowed if it is an ICMP reply, source quench (tells the source to reduce the pace of traffic), or any ICMP unreachable message.
