Debug mode in Django is a setting (`DEBUG=True`) that helps in the application development phase by providing detailed error pages when something goes wrong, **but It's a security risk in a production environment and should be turned off** ðŸ¥¸

To do that we need to **request an endpoint that does not exist** in the application, for example:
```sh
- /doesnotexist 
- /api/doesnotexist 
```
