It demonstrates **accountability** and provides **oversight** to **ensure** that any risks are adequately mitigated and that security strategies are aligned with the organization’s business objectives and are **compliant** with regulations.

 A person who determines the purposes for **which**, and the **way** in **which**, personal data is processed.

A person or organization who processes personal data on **behalf** of the data controller.

A person who **oversees** an organization’s data protection strategy.

Demonstrates an organization’s **commitment** to security.

Some are just curious, while others try to demonstrate their skills by causing harm.

Even though they are using basic tools, the results can still be devastating.

Hacktivists are hackers who protest against a variety of political and social ideas.

One of the more lucrative goals of cybercriminals is obtaining lists of PII that can then be sold on the dark web.

**Stolen** PII can be used to create fake financial accounts, such as credit cards and **short-term loans**.

The second most common way that threat actors **breached** a network was by using **stolen** PSI.

Companies are increasingly worried about corporate espionage in cyberspace.

The loss of intellectual property to competitors is a serious concern.

SOCs can be wholly in-house

Job roles in a SOC are rapidly evolving

When verification is established, the incident can be forwarded to investigators or other security personnel to be acted upon.

Otherwise, the alert may be dismissed as a false alarm.

SIEM and security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) are often paired together as they have capabilities that complement each other.

However, SOAR technology goes a step further

Note however, that metrics that describe blanket performance frequently do not paint an accurate picture of SOC operation **due** to the diversity of cybersecurity threats.

Security personnel understand that for the organization to accomplish its priorities, network availability must be preserved.

That tolerance is usually based **upon** a comparison of the cost of the downtime in relation to the cost of **ensuring** **against** downtime.

That ran over MS-DOS

The disk operating system still controlled the computer and its hardware.

The operating system itself is in direct control of the computer and its hardware.

which truly deletes them.


A vulnerability is some **flaw** or **weakness**

**Conversely**, programs such as user applications

 User mode code must go through the operating system to access hardware resources.

may run in either kernel or user mode

By having its own process

rendering other applications unable

NTFS is the most widely used file system for Windows for many reasons.

Data access control is achieved through security descriptors.

NTFS is also very reliable

These security descriptors contain file ownership and permissions all the way down to the file level.

NTFS also tracks many time stamps to track file activity

Files that are left open

and applications that hang can all be damaged

 the shutdown will appear to hang

Care should be taken

 Some of these attacks come so quickly that defenses against them have not yet been devised and distributed.

developers are always trying to stay ahead of the attackers

It may take several different programs

Linux operating systems are generally regarded as better protected against malware.

While arguably better protected,

 and even tamper with troubleshooting and diagnostic tools

We do not really care

we seldom care

Let's all agree that

Addresses that are held in log files

either within an organization,

Operating without regard to the data carried

This means the transport layer segments can be readily packaged by IPv4 or IPv6 or by any new protocol that might be developed in the future.

senders are unaware whether destination devices are present

nor are they aware if the destination receives the packet,


beyond the local network segment


Did you ever wonder

 Whenever a source device has a packet with an IPv4 address on another network

Understanding the role of port numbers will help you to grasp the details of the TCP communication process.

the additional retransmission of the TCP segments can make the congestion **even worse**

in a timely **manner**

The data transfer can happen in **either** direction.

Due to the low cost and superiority of Ethernet switching, hubs are **seldom** used today.

Signatures can be used to detect severe **breaches** of security

**regardless** of the location of the attack target.

Viruses can be **harmless**,

A virus is a type of malware that **spreads** by inserting a copy of itself into another program.

Whereas a virus requires a host program to run,

Ransomware has evolved to become the most profitable malware type in history. In the first half of 2016, ransomware campaigns targeting both individual and enterprise users became more widespread and potent.

There are **dozens** of ransomware variants.

Malware is a **means** to get a payload delivered.
